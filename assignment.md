## Review: `Array.prototype.map()`
The `Array.prototype.map()` method returns a new array with the results of calling a function on every element in an existing array. This allows for the transformation of each element inside the array, without altering the original.

Take a look at the example below:

```
const array1 = ['vanilla', 'chocolate', 'strawberry'];

const array2 = array1.map((currentElement) => {
  return currentElement + ' ice cream';
});

console.log(array2); // ['vanilla ice cream', 'chocolate ice cream', 'strawberry ice cream']
```

In this example, we’ve used the `Array.prototype.map()` method on `array1 `to generate `array2`. Each element in `array2` is the result of appending `' ice cream'` to the end of a string element in `array1`.

The `Array.prototype.map()` method is used to iterate over `array1`. For every element in `array1`, it will call upon the provided function. When the function is called upon, it receives the current element being processed as an argument. The value returned from the function will take the place of the original element in the new array.

> `Array.prototype.map()` returns a **new array** with altered values. It does *not* alter the original array

### Exercise 1: Applying `Array.prototype.map()`

```
// Use `.map()` to iterate over the following array:

const nums = [13, 87, 2, 89, 12, 4, 90, 63];

// Create a new array where each value is multiplied by 2 and log the new array.

// Your code here
```

## Array Destructuring
Array destructuring in JavaScript is a way of unpacking the elements of an array. With array destructuring, we can extract elements from an array and store them in variables with a single line of code.

When we destructure an array, the elements are matched positionally with the variables we define, meaning the order in which we declare variables corresponds with the order of elements in the array.

```
const petsArray = ['Rover', 'Snuffles', 'Toto', 'Spot'];

const [firstPet, secondPet] = petsArray;

console.log(firstPet); // 'Rover'
console.log(secondPet); // 'Snuffles'

// Equivalent in traditional bracket notation:
console.log(petsArray[0]); // 'Rover'
console.log(petsArray[1]); // 'Snuffles'
```

In the example above, the first two elements of `petsArray` are unpacked into `firstPet` and `secondPet`.

> You have full control of the variable names!

### Exercise 2: Array Destructuring

```
// Given the following array, use destructuring to pull out the first and second values and place them into variables. Log both variables.

const pizzaToppings = ['Pineapple', 'Olives', 'Anchovies'];

// Your code here
```

## Review: Object Destructuring
Destructuring can also be applied to objects. With object destructuring, we can extract properties from an object. Instead of accessing properties through dot notation or bracket notation, the values of specific properties in an object can be assigned to variables.

```
const person = {
  name: 'Alex',
  role: 'Software Engineer',
};

// Object destructuring:
const { name, role } = person;

console.log(name); // 'Alex'
console.log(role); // 'Software Engineer'

// Equivalent in traditional dot notation:
console.log(person.name); // 'Alex'
console.log(person.role); // 'Software Engineer'
```

In the example above, the `person` object is deconstructed to extract the `name` and `role` properties. This approach allows us to access the values of `name` and `role` without having to use dot notation for each property.

> Unlike array destructuring, where elements are matched based on their position, the variables created in object destructuring, such as `const { name, role }`, need to match the names of existing properties in the object.

### Exercise 3: Destructuring objects

```
// Given the following object, use destructuring to create variables `make` and `model` that will hold the respective values.

const car = {
  make: 'Audi',
  model: 'q5',
};

// Your code here
```

## Review: Applying the spread operator on arrays
The spread operator (`...`) gives us a way to duplicate or combine arrays. Instead of manually copying elements from one array to another using loops, the spread operator allows us to directly copy the elements of one array into another.

```
const originalArray = [1, 2, 3];
const duplicateArray = [...originalArray];

console.log(duplicateArray); // [1, 2, 3]
```

In the example above, `duplicateArray` is an entirely separate array produced by copying the contents of `originalArray`.

This differs from simply assigning one array to another, which only creates a reference, not a copy:

```
const originalArray = [1, 2, 3];
const referenceArray = originalArray; // referenceArray is now a reference to originalArray

referenceArray.push(4); // Modifying referenceArray also modifies originalArray
console.log(originalArray); // [1, 2, 3, 4]
```

The spread operator prevents this issue by ensuring the new array is an independent copy that shares no references with the original. This can be useful when we need to maintain the immutability of the original array.

The spread operator can also merge multiple arrays into one:

```
const fruits = ['apple', 'orange', 'banana'];
const vegetables = ['broccoli', 'carrot', 'spinach'];

const fruitsAndVegetables = [...fruits, ...vegetables];

console.log(fruitsAndVegetables); // ['apple', 'orange', 'banana', 'broccoli', 'carrot', 'spinach']
```

>  When merging multiple arrays, be sure to include the spread operator. Not doing so can result in unintentional nesting.

### Exercise 4: Applying the spead operator on arrays

```
// Duplicate the following array using the spread operator and assign it to `controversialPizzaToppings`. Then, log the variable.

const pizzaToppings = ['Pineapple', 'Olives', 'Anchovies'];

// Your code here
```

## Review: Applying the spread operator on objects
The spread operator can also be applied to objects:

```
const originalObject = {
  foo: 'Hello',
  bar: 100,
};

const clonedObject = { ...originalObject };
console.log('Clone: ', clonedObject); // { foo: 'Hello', bar: 100 }
```

In the example above, we can see how the properties of `originalObject` have been copied over into a new object called `clonedObject`.

The use of the spread operator here differs significantly from direct assignment:

```
const originalObject = {
  foo: 'Hello',
  bar: 100,
};

const clonedObject = originalObject;
clonedObject.foo = 'Goodbye';

console.log(originalObject); // { foo: 'Goodbye', bar: 100 }
```

The example above demonstrates a pitfall of attempting to clone an object **without the spread operator**. When `clonedObject` is assigned `originalObject` directly, it doesn’t actually create a new, independent object. Instead, `clonedObject` becomes a reference to `originalObject`. This means any changes made to `clonedObject` also affect `originalObject`, as they both point to the same data.

Like with Arrays, this issue can be remedied when we apply the spread operator:

```
const originalObject = {
  foo: 'Hello',
  bar: 100,
};

// Copy the properties of originalObject:
const clonedObject = { ...originalObject };

// Update the properties of clonedObject:
clonedObject.foo = 'Goodbye';
clonedObject.bar = 0;

console.log('Original: ', originalObject); // { foo: 'Hello', bar: 100 }
console.log('Clone: ', clonedObject); // { foo: 'Goodbye', bar: 0 }
```

With the spread operator, `clonedObject` is a brand new object, with its own separate copy of the data from `originalObject`. Now, modifying `clonedObject` will not impact the `originalObject`

### Exercise 5: Applying the spread operator on objects

```
// Duplicate the following object and spread its values into a new variable `myCar`.

const car = {
  make: 'Audi',
  model: 'q5',
};

// Change the `model` property of `myCar` to 'q7'. Log both objects.

// Your code here
```

## Review: Dynamic keys in objects
Through bracket notation, variables and expressions can be used as dynamic keys in an object. Dynamic keys can be used to create, access, and modify properties in an object. Dynamic keys enhance our ability to access data. This approach is particularly useful in scenarios where key names are not known ahead of time or when they need to be computed on the fly. It also allows for more concise and readable code, avoiding the need for additional steps when assigning properties to objects.

Take for example, the use of `selectedFruit` as a dynamic key in the codeblock below:

```
const fruitInventory = {
  apples: 2,
  oranges: 4,
};

const selectedFruit = 'apples'; // Variable as a dynamic key
const selectedFruitCount = fruitInventory[selectedFruit];

console.log(selectedFruitCount); // 2
```

This technique can be extended to the creation of objects, where property names are determined dynamically:

```
const fruitType = 'bananas'; // Variable as a dynamic key

const fruitInventory = {
  [fruitType]: 5,
};

console.log(fruitInventory); // { bananas: 5 }
```

Using square brackets (`[]`) around `fruitType` in the object declaration tells JavaScript to use the variable’s value as the property name. Without the brackets, the string `'fruitType'` would be used as the key, rather than its value (`'bananas'`).

### Exercise 6: Dynamic keys in objects

```
// Create an object named userProfile. 
// Define a variable named propertyName and assign a string to it (like a username, age, or email). 
// Use propertyName as a dynamic key in userProfile, assigning a relevant value.

// Your code here
```
